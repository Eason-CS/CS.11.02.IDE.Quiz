To be completed with a partner.
There is to be only one laptop that will be used for this assessment. 
Partner A will assume the role of the driver initially. Partner A will do all of the typing.
Partner B will assume the role of the navigator initially. Partner B will do none of the typing.
You must not use the internet for this assessment. The purpose is to struggle together =)
After every x minutes has elapsed, Partner A and Partner B will stand up and switch seats. This action represents the swapping of roles.
